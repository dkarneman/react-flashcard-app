# React Flashcard App

I developed this app to help me study for the AWS Certification exams. There are hundreds of AWS
services to memorize, and I wanted flashcards to help me study. I also wanted more practice with
React, so this was a perfect project to kill two birds with one stone.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
and based on a [a project by Dev.to](https://dev.to/drew_womble/create-a-flashcard-application-using-react-53ij)
with some modifications that allow me to shuffle them and remove ones I've already memorized.

I hope you find it useful!
